# paho-freight
PAHO buys pharmaceuticals in bulk for member states, shipping them overseas to various American countries. They've been using rough percentage rates (+20% shipping free) to estimate shipping costs, which has been inadequate.

On this project, the team will:
(1) Refine a predictive model for estimating freight costs using new features (distance, ports, fuel indexes, congestion)
(2) Productionize the models into a usable software tool (API/web app) that PAHO and member states can use directly.
